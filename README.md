### Exploring COMPAS Bias
> A LEGALST123 2019 Spring Project by Zekai Fan and Violet Yao

### What is COMPAS?
> COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendantâ€™s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism).

> [COMPAS Technical Document](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/technical_documents/FieldGuide2_081412.pdf) Chapter three: campas validity and reliability especially worth attention. 

### What is ProPublica's story "Machine Bias"?
> ProPublica analyzed COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm and found that black defendants were far more likely white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism. 

### What do we want to do?
> While prior researches questioning fairness of COMPAS focus on racial factor, we want to investigate into how other factors, such as age, marial status, gender, crime history, etc, may result in biased COMPOS score.

> Potential feature list: gender, age at sentence, race, employment status, education, marial status, illicit drug use, sentence type (probation, alternatives, prison)
